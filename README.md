## Coffee Emotion Detection and Heart Rate Recommendation System
### This project is aimed at developing a machine learning system that detects human emotions and heart rate using computer vision and deep learning techniques, and then recommends a suitable coffee to match the user's mood and heart rate. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify emotions, a heart rate detection algorithm, and a recommendation system based on user's inputs.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available but is limited in terms of its scope and quality. Future models can benefit from more diverse and larger datasets, which could improve the accuracy of the predictions.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file. Use pip to install them.
3. Run the "main.py" script to launch the application.


## Usage
The Coffee Emotion Detection and Heart Rate Recommendation System is easy to use. The user can run the application and follow the on-screen instructions to capture their image and get the recommendation. The system uses a webcam to capture the user's image, and then the image is processed using the CNN model to detect the user's emotions. Once the emotions are detected, the heart rate detection algorithm is used to determine the user's heart rate. Finally, the recommendation system uses the user's mood and heart rate to recommend a suitable coffee.
